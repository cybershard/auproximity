# AUProximity

[![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/HEROKU-ONLINE-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku)](https://auproxy.herokuapp.com)

AUProximity is an open source proximity voice chat platform, primarily aimed at Among Us.

I have an open instance hosted on [Heroku](https://auproxy.herokuapp.com).

This software should be used for personal use on public lobbies. Anyone that wants to
have a custom solution, private server, or other commercial use for this software should 
send a direct message to `Cybershard#3935` on Discord. This software comes with NO warranty.

## Features
- The software can connect to a public game to host proximity voice services
- Run as a plugin on Impostor or other private servers.
- There is also planned support for a [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod,
which will serve the purpose of sending positional data to the backend server.
  - Currently, the Impostor plugin and BepInEx mod are separate projects and are closed source.

## Developer Quickstart
> Note: This project uses `yarn`, so install it if you do not have it already.

Follow the steps below to run a server and webui with hot-reload
- Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- Run `yarn serve` in the `auproximity` directory
- Run `yarn serve` in the `auproximity-webui` directory
- By default, the server will listen on port `8079` and the webui will listen on port `8080`
  - If you want to change this, edit the `consts.ts` file in both the 
  `auproximity` directory and the `auproximity-webui` directory

> Note: The `heroku-postbuild` script is for Heroku deployment only.
> Do NOT use them for development or production testing, as it WILL break.

## Architecture
This repository contains two different modules, the server and the webui.
 - The webui contains a basic implementation of a proximity voice client.
 - The server maintains connections between all proximity voice clients,
 serves as a WebRTC signaling service, and contains all the backends for positional data.

This design makes it very easy to have any provider for positional data (e.g., server plugin, BepInEx mod).
As well, the client can have any implementation, as basic websockets are used to transfer positional data.
In the base implementation, the client is the webui, and uses Web Audio APIs to connect to other clients.
However, the client manages the voice system completely. As such, the client can easily be extended
to create a desktop application, an application that interfaces with Discord RPC, and even features like minimaps!  

## Contributing
I welcome PRs for adding additional backends, client features, and even forks for other games. 

This repository follows an issue-based workflow. Issues should be created to identify
features and bugs being worked on, and PRs should close the issues they target
for fixes and/or implementations.
